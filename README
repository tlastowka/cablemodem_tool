tools for interacting with a Technicolor cable modem from Comcast/XFINITY


Cable Providers don't exactly make it easy to integrate their hardware with anything else.

If they give you anything, its probably a web interface to the modem.  No snmp or syslog.

My connection acts up from time to time.  Usually rebooting it will fix it.

I wanted to be able to gather the logs and reboot the modem from a command line, so I could
do it automatically.  This does that.

requires python3 and the dependencies in requirements.txt

No idea what else it will work on, but was tested on the one I have:

    HARDWARE
    --------

    Model: TC8305C
    HW Identifier: 1.5
    Processor Speed: 600 Mhz
    DRAM: 128 MB
    Flash: 64 MB

    SOFTWARE
    --------

    eMTA & DOCSIS Software Version: 01.E6.01.22.25
    Packet Cable: 2.0


USAGE

  The functions are intended to be imported from a larger program, but it will work from the command line

usage: cmtool.py [-h] [--address ADDRESS] [--username USERNAME]
                 [--password PASSWORD]
                 {logs,reboot}

positional arguments:
  {logs,reboot}

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --address ADDRESS
  --username USERNAME
  --password PASSWORD


address, username and password all use the defaults comcast gave me on mine if not provided

To display the logs:

 > python cmtool.py logs

To reboot

 > python cmtool.py reboot


TROUBLESHOOTING:

  If something fails, it probably means your modem is unreachable, or uses a different interface than the one mine does.

  For the former, Make sure its reachable with a web browser and that username/password/address are correct.

  For the latter, comcast uses a similar interface in a lot of modems, but it varies a little.  You could probably modify this easily to support yours.
  A few minutes inspecting post requests with Firebug or Chrome Developer Tools is all it should take
